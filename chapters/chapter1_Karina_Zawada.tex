\subsection{Beauty of mountains}

\textbf{The Tatra Mountains} located on the border between Poland and Slovakia, are a stunning range known for their dramatic peaks and diverse ecosystems. As part of the Carpathian mountain range, they attract hikers, climbers, and nature enthusiasts from around the world, the numbers are shown in Table \ref{tab:table1_kz} . \textit{The breathtaking landscapes feature rugged rock formations, lush forests, and a variety of wildlife}, making it a \underline{UNESCO} Biosphere Reserve. With trails for all skill levels, the Tatras offer visitors a chance to experience the beauty of the mountains year-round.

\textbf{The Black Pond}, is one of the most picturesque lakes in the Tatra Mountains as shown in Figure \ref{fig:czarny_staw}. Nestled in the Gasienicowa Valley, this glacial lake is renowned for its clear, dark waters that reflect the surrounding \textit{peaks}. It serves as a popular starting point for numerous hiking trails, including routes leading to the \textit{majestic Koscielec and other nearby summits}. The serene atmosphere and stunning views make Czarny Staw Gasienicowy a \underline{must-visit} destination for anyone exploring the Tatras.

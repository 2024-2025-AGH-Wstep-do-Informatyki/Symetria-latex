Formula for the Discriminant:
\flushleft
The discriminant, often called "delta," is a distinguishing value of a quadratic trinomial.
Given a quadratic function in the form:

$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$

where a, b and c are the coefficients of the quadratic function, and $a \ne 0$,
the formula for the discriminant is as follows:

$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$
